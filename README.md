# DesertBus
Program that automates the desert bus minigame from Penn and Tellers Smoke and Mirrors.
The program utilizes the opencv-python library to apply edge detecting and a hough transform to identify the lines for the bus to follow.


# To use

To use the program, make sure that the emulator controls are bound such that 'a' is bound to 'a', 'left' is bound to 'k', and 'right' is bound to 'l'. Also use emulator in windowed mode while maximized to ensure that BBOX is accurate
